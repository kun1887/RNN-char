# Vanilla RNN from scratch

Implementation of a vanilla characters level RNN using only Numpy for learning purposes.

Main objectives:

- Gain stronger intuition on Recurrent mechanism in deep learning
- Learn how to implement step by step time dependent backpropagation without using any DL library.
